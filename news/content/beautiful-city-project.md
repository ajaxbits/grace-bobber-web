I will be joining many other Chicago artists in a summer series that features 100 musical theatre hits from 100 different musicals. I am delighted to be singing backup on a song that is particularly dear to my heart - “Me and the Sky” from Come From Away. This series will begin on June 1st, with one new song posted on Facebook each day. Stay tuned for when you’ll be hearing Come From Away, and be sure to like [The Beautiful City Project](https://www.facebook.com/thebeautifulcityproject/) on Facebook!

> “THE BEAUTIFUL CITY PROJECT is committed to using musical theatre as a tool to give back to the Chicago community, intent on building a promising tomorrow for a beautiful city. Cabaret performances highlight a different organization every month, while the mainstage programming of musicals in concert take a community issue head-on, raising awareness and funds to be given directly to an organization in need, making an immediate impact. A city-wide campaign of beautification and positivity will be the hallmark of a project intent on taking real action in our beautiful city.”
