Iâ€™m partnering with [High Plateau Productions](https://www.facebook.com/highplateauproductions/) to put on an hour-long solo set from the comfort of my home! Please join me as I play some of my favorite covers, as well as a few never-before-heard originals. You can buy a $4 ticket to my show by clicking the Eventbrite link below. High Plateau puts artists first, so all proceeds from ticket sales will go directly to me! This is a super easy way to help me start from the ground up and get my original music up and running. [Give HPP a follow](https://www.facebook.com/highplateauproductions/) to stay tuned for updates and learn about other artists that they are supporting!
