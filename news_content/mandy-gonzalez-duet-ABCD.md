Iâ€™m honored to be singing with actor Mandy Gonzalez as a part of a virtual fundraiser held by ABCD (After Breast Cancer Diagnosis), an organization that "nurtures hope and restores confidence in anyone impacted by breast cancer." ABCD means so much to my family and me, and I'd love if you tuned in to catch me singing with Mandy Gonzalez for a bit as a part of this fundraiser.
