Despite the challenges that COVID-19 has presented to the theater industry, Metropolis Performing Arts Center in Arlington Heights, IL plans to present “Mamma Mia!” this summer. I am psyched to be playing the role of Lisa. Come join us (at a safe distance)! Tickets [here](https://app.arts-people.com/index.php?show=99590).
