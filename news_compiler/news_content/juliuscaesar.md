I will be joining a virtual presentation of Shakespeare's "Julius Caesar" as Calpurnia/Messala. Check out this 80-minute performance on [Evergreen Theatre Collective's Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/EvergreenTheatreCollective) on Sunday, Sept 20th at 7:30 CST. Donations to the company will be split between the artists involved and [Know Your Rights Camp](https://www.knowyourrightscamp.com/).
